    <div class="text-x-large">Easy Peanut Noodles</div>
    This recipe is quick, easy, and convenient:
    <ul>
      <li>It takes about 1 hour from start to finish, including cleanup.</li>
      <li>You don't need to chop anything.</li>
      <li>It's made with pantry staples that don't go bad quickly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Makes 5 servings</p>
    <b>Ingredients</b>
    <br />
    For the tofu:
    <ul>
      <li>1 block (16 ounces) of firm tofu</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp of oil</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    For the noodles:
    <ul>
      <li>10 ounces of noodles</li>
      <li>60 grams (1/4 cup) of peanut butter</li>
      <li>60 grams (1/4 cup) of warm water</li>
      <li>15 gram (1 Tbsp) of soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    For the veggies:
    <ul>
      <li>1 Tbsp of oil</li>
      <li>3-5 cups of frozen stir-fry vegetables</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp of soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Instructions</b>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil water for the noodles. Fill a pot about halfway full, cover with a lid, and put on the stove on high
        heat.</li>
      <li>Turn on the oven for 350 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. This makes it easier to
        clean.</li>
      <li>Drain the tofu. Pat dry, and crumble it onto the baking sheet. Add the oil, salt, and spices. Plop in the
        oven
        for 35 minutes.</li>
      <li>Cook the noodles until soft. Check the package for the cook time.
        <b>Important:</b> Do a taste test to make sure they're cooked.
      <li>Drain and rinse the noodles in cold water. This prevents them from sticking together.
      </li>
      </li>
      <li>Make the peanut sauce. Stir together the peanut butter, water, and soy sauce until smooth.</li>
      <li>Cook the veggies. In a pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Plop in the veggies and soy sauce. Cook until just
        tender (~5-10 minutes).</li>
      <li>For meal prep, divide the tofu, noodles, peanut sauce, and veggies into 5 equal portions. Leftovers keep in
        the fridge for up to 5 days.</li>
    </ol>
    <b>Notes</b>
    <ul>
      <li>I use Costco rice ramen and frozen stir-fry vegetable blend. For the rice ramen, I use 4 bricks (10 ounces).
        Here's a picture for reference:</li>

        <img src="/assets/frozen-stir-fry-vegetables.png" height="250" />
      </p>
      <li>The cook time for Costco rice ramen is misleading. The package says 3 minutes, but it actually took 6-7
        minutes. This is why you should taste your noodles and make sure they're done.</li>
      <li>For the tofu, you don't need to wait for the oven to preheat. It's not finicky - the goal is just to make the
        tofu chewier and more flavorful. Put whatever spices you like.</li>
      <li>I like having 2 ounces of noodles per serving. If you have a 16 ounce bag of spaghetti, you can cook half (8
        ounces) and make 4 servings.</li>
    </ul>
